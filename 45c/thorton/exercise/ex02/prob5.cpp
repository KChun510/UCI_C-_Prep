What are the design benefits of passing a parameter by reference? What can you do when you pass by reference that you can't do when you pass by value?
Suppose you were going to write a function with one parameter, and that the result would be the same whether you passed the parameter by value or by reference â€” it's not always the case that the outcome will be different. In what circumstances would you expect the pass-by-value version to run faster? In what circumstances would you expect the pass-by-value version to use less memory?
Same situation as the previous question. In what circumstances would you expect the pass-by-reference version to run faster? In what circumstances would you expect the pass-by-reference version to use less memory?

// 1. When passing by value, it's good if you don't want to edit
// the underlying var it self. (Passing a copy)
//
// 2. When passing by referance, your going to manipulating the value located in the mem address.
